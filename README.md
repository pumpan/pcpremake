# FillRaidBots

## Overview

This addon is a remake off the **PartyBot Command Panel (PCP)** for **World of Warcraft (WoW) 1.12.1** helps users efficiently fill a raid with bots and manage them through an intuitive command panel. It includes features for setting up bot configurations, managing presets for various dungeons and raids, and automating bot removal.

## Features

- **A Resizable Frame:**
   You can resize the frame to better fit your screen by draging the handle in the bottom right corner.

- **Themes:**
  You can chose a theme if you would like another color.

- **Controll bots when you are dead:**
  - You can controll bots when you are dead.
    
- **Reset frame position:**
  By writing /pcp move the pcp frame moves to your cursor.
  this will solve an issue that the original pcp addon had where for some people the pcpframe wasnt showing (becouse the frame is outside of the visual screen)
